Environmental strains affecting naval materials are particularly powerful, especially in case of installations realized on ship decks, where they are exposed both to weather conditions and mechanical stress. The main goal of the NAUMATEST project was to develop a new testing device for testing such materials, in order to be able to ensure the following requirements:",

          "P4": "Because of the high complexity of design and production, the device has no analogues on the market. In fact, through a single device it will be able to test materials used in the naval outfitting, considering the unfavorable environmental conditions  found in tropical zones, and wear due to their intensive use. The collaboration between Sultan and <cite>La Sapienza</cite>, established during the preliminary phase and the implementation of the project, is currently underway and has led Sultan to be inserted in the Ministerial project Cluster Italy 2020 about the Marine Mobility <cite>TRIM Industrial Research and Technology for Marine Mobility</cite> in partnership with <cite>La Sapienza</cite> and Fincantieri and the only small/medium-sized company in Friuli Venezia Giulia.",
